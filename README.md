Issue<br>
With having two WiFi networks (2.4G for range and 5G for speed) there is an issue that 2.4 connects first 
as it has broader signal range leaving peer with slover speeds that eventually will becase available as 5G signal comes in range.

Solve<br>
Create service with WiFi change listener that will connect to 5G as it becames available.
